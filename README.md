# Python

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language that is widely used for web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and scientific computing. Its simple syntax and dynamic nature make it a great choice for beginners and experienced programmers alike.

In this repo I covered all the basics of Python language.

## Variables
In Python, variables are used to store and manipulate data. Variables are declared by giving them a name and assigning a value to them.

### Example:

x = 5
y = "Hello, World!"

## Data Types
Python has several built-in data types, including:

<b>int: used for whole numbers
<b>float: used for decimal numbers
<b>str: used for strings of characters
<b>bool: used for True/False values
<b>list: used for lists of items
dict: used for key-value pairs
Operators
Python has several operators that can be used to perform mathematical and logical operations on variables. These include:

+: used for addition
-: used for subtraction
*: used for multiplication
/: used for division
%: used for modulus (remainder)
==: used for equality comparison
!=: used for inequality comparison
<: used for less than comparison
>: used for greater than comparison
Control Flow
Python provides several control flow statements that can be used to control the flow of execution in a program. These include:

if: used for conditional execution
for: used for looping through a sequence of items
while: used for looping while a condition is true
Functions
Functions are a way to organize and reuse code. In Python, functions are defined using the def keyword, followed by the function name and a set of parentheses that contain any parameters the function takes. For example:

Copy code
def greet(name):
    print("Hello, " + name + "!")

greet("John") # Outputs "Hello, John!"
Classes
Classes are a way to create objects that have their own methods and properties. In Python, classes are defined using the class keyword, followed by the class name and a set of parentheses that contain the parent class, if any. For example:

Copy code
class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name, breed):
        self.name = name
        self.breed = breed

    def bark(self):
        print("Woof!")

dog = Dog("Fido", "Golden Retriever")
print(dog.name) # Outputs "Fido"
dog.bark() # Outputs "Woof!"
This should give a basic understanding on python concepts. Happy Coding!
